Java enums:- 
***
In Java, an enum (short for enumeration) is a type that has a fixed set of constant values. We use the enum keyword to declare enums. For example,

enum Size { 
   SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, EXTRALARGE 
}
Here, we have created an enum named Size. It contains fixed values SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE, and EXTRALARGE.

These values inside the braces are called enum constants (values).

Note: The enum constants are usually represented in uppercase.

Enum Class in Java
In Java, enum types are considered to be a special type of class. It was introduced with the release of Java 5.

An enum class can include methods and fields just like regular classes.

enum Size {
    constant1, constant2, â€¦, constantN;

    // methods and fields	
}
When we create an enum class, the compiler will create instances (objects) of each enum constants. Also, all enum constant is always public static final by default.

Methods of Java Enum Class
There are some predefined methods in enum classes that are readily available for use.

1. Java Enum ordinal()
The ordinal() method returns the position of an enum constant. For example,

ordinal(SMALL) 
// returns 0

2. Enum compareTo()
The compareTo() method compares the enum constants based on their ordinal value. For example,

Size.SMALL.compareTo(Size.MEDIUM)
 // returns ordinal(SMALL) - ordinal(MEDIUM)

3. Enum toString()
The toString() method returns the string representation of the enum constants. For example,

SMALL.toString()
// returns "SMALL"

4. Enum name()
The name() method returns the defined name of an enum constant in string form. The returned value from the name() method is final. For example,

name(SMALL)
// returns "SMALL"

5. Java Enum valueOf()
The valueOf() method takes a string and returns an enum constant having the same string name. For example,

Size.valueOf("SMALL")
// returns constant SMALL.

6. Enum values()
The values() method returns an array of enum type containing all the enum constants. For example,

Size[] enumArray = Size.value();

enum Constructor:-In Java, an enum class may include a constructor like a regular class. These enum constructors are either

private - accessible within the class
or
package-private - accessible within the package

Java enum Strings:-

In Java, we can get the string representation of enum constants using the toString() method or the name() method. 

Change Default String Value of enums

We can change the default string representation of enum constants by overriding the toString() method.

Note: We cannot override the name() method. It is because the name() method is final.
